# AndrewCards

This app implements an interface of paper cards, with words/phrases
written on each side of a card.

2 main modes are available:
1. REVIEW: look through the set of cards, try guessing the other side of the card
2. lay the cards in front of you, see all of them at one side, occasionally look at the other side of one of the cards (or all of them)   

Some of the further instructions can be found in help messages, or after I update this file.
Or you can write an email to me. 

Run the app:

`python3 main.py`

Run the exercise for a specific file

`python3 main.py myfile.txt`
